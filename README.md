### lit-html and hyperactive application with no bundling

This project is an example that shows how easy it is to create a Web app with 

- `lit-html` (templating library) and
 - `hyperactive` (ES6 proxy library)
 
without and bundling. 

For small Web apps this will work just fine. For large apps you may find a reason, eventually, to start bundling in order to reduce the number of files that have to be loaded individually by the browser.
